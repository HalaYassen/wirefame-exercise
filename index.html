                        Where does it come from?<br />

                        Contrary to popular belief
                        , Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
                        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College
                        in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                        passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                        undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
                        et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
                        on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                        "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                        Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
                        in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
                        Rackham.
